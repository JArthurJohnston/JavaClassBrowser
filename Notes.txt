-In the future Id like to implement my own List class that
uses valueAdded and valueChanged listeners.
-ProjectModel should not allow the user to delete a package if that package is the only one left in its list.
-when adding classes/packages/etc... the recieving object should set the parent of the newly added/edited object. 
	thus I could just go new ClassModel("AName") instead of new ClassModel(parentPackage, "AName")
-make a subckass of LinkedList which will return itself whenever you perform an operation on it. that way we can more easily chain method calls together, and further avoid assignment statements.
-refactor the updateModel stuff to use fired events and listeners...
	-wont have to propogat signals (modelAdded, modelRemoved, etc...)
		-well, Ill still need those methods on the UI, but not on the models, or main.
	-main wont have to hold a list of its open windows. each shellModel will be responsible for
		itself
	-wont have to use mocks anymore :D
-add an isMemberOf(aModel) so a class can say if its part of a package or project. this will return true if the ALL package is selected
-heres an awesome idea, the Models (entities) should NOT throw exceptions. let that be handled by the UI. or exceptions should only be thrown by ProjectModel.
-ill definitely cache the ALL class list for the class tree panel, but i may want to consider caching all of the class trees. invalidate them (set them to null) when a change is made, and then lazy init them in their getters....
-when writing version 2.0 make models subclasses of ClassTree or ModelTree or VariableTree, etc...
